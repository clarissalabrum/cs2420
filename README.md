# CS 2420

## This repository contains projects for my CS 2420 class, Algorithms and Data Structures. All projects were completed with Java.

For the [AVLTree](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/AVLTree) project I needed to create an **AVL Tree** structure and used it to play the ladder game. I loaded a 
dictionary into the AVL tree and then created logic that would search through the dictionary to find a word that was one letter off from the original. Given starting and ending 
words the program would try to create a path through different words to get from the start to the end.

The [HashPoetry](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/HashPoetry) project loads a poem into a **hash table** and saves the following word and then displays the 
hash table. It then uses logic and a starting word to display a random poem based on the occurrences in the hash table.

[HexDisjoint](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/HexDisjoint) uses a **disjoint set** to play a hex game with preloaded moves. The game keeps track of players moves 
in disjoint sets and will display the sets and announce the winner, who is the first person to get a connect path across the board.

[MaxFlow](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/MaxFlow) uses a **graph** to find the most efficient path from start to end given flow constraints.

The [PriorityQueue](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/PriorityQueue) uses a **priority queue** to schedule out tasks in the most efficient way it can. It will then
the priority of the tasks and is the tasks were completed on time.

The [Recursion](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/Recursion) project was an assignment to advance our recursion skills. There are 14 different recursive problems.

The [WordLadder](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/cs2420/tree/master/WordLadder) project solves the same problem that the AVLTree project did without using a data structure.
